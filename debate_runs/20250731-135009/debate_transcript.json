A Stanford study of 16,000 workers over 9 months found that working from home increased productivity by 13%. A report by Global Workplace Analytics estimates that employers can save over $11,000 per half-time remote employee per year in real estate, electricity, and other costs. The evidence demonstrates that remote work is not just a matter of employee preference but a sound business strategy. The increase in productivity, coupled with significant cost savings for employers and improved well-being for employees, makes a compelling case for its broader adoption."}}
